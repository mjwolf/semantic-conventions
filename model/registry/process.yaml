        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          A globally unique identifier of the process.
        note: |
          This can be any format of unique indentifier.

          Where possible, it is RECOMMENDED that this is calculated
          MD5 hash of the string `<pid>_<starttime>_<bootid>`:

          | Key | Description | Example Value |
          | --- | --- | --- |
          | `pid` | PID | "1201" |
          | `starttime` | The process start time in seconds since system boot | "3029" |
          | `bootid` | The boot ID, as read from `/proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id` | "16b6f4a4-179e-4480-9561-0df471d8c6d4" |

          For example, md5("1201_3029_16b6f4a4-179e-4480-9561-0df471d8c6d4") -> "230d8ee6147ded8e31dcef082bdbc383"

          By following this method, the same entity_id will be generated by all
          observers of a given process.
